## Investing in Surf Boards and Ice Cream: Oahu meteorological analysis
 
### Overview:

The purpose of this analysis is to bring insight to investors to a potential combination surf board/ice cream shop on Oahu. In order for investors to have confidence in the business, they will need to explore what the weather is like on the island. This is due to the fact that surfing and ice cream are highly dependent on meteorological phenomena such as temperature and rain. Investors are specifically looking for data on June and December weather on Oahu to determine the likelyhood of success.
Situated 108 feet above sea level, the weather station "Waihee 837.5", the most active on the Oahu network, will be used for the meteorological analysis.  This low-lying station overlooking the shores NNE (north-north-east) of Honolulu will be very representative of typical beach weather on Oahu.
